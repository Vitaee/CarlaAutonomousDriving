# Speed-Conditioned Steering Model Training

## Overview

This implementation adds **speed-conditioned steering prediction** to improve autonomous driving performance across different velocity ranges. The model learns speed-dependent steering patterns, addressing the fundamental issue where the same visual scene requires different steering responses at different speeds.

## Why Speed-Conditioned Models?

### The Problem
- **Low speed (10-15 km/h)**: Requires responsive, precise steering for tight maneuvers
- **High speed (30+ km/h)**: Needs smooth, predictive steering to prevent instability
- **Single model limitation**: Traditional models learn one steering pattern regardless of speed

### The Solution
- **Multi-modal input**: Image + Current Speed → Steering Angle  
- **Speed-aware features**: Neural network learns different steering strategies per speed range
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Model automatically adjusts steering style based on current velocity

## Architecture Changes

### Model Modifications

Both `NvidiaModel` and `NvidiaModelTransferLearning` now support speed input:

```python
# Speed embedding network
self.speed_embedding = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(1, 16),      # Speed input (normalized 0-1)
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(16, 32),     # 32-dimensional speed features
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Dropout(0.1)
)

# Combined features: Visual (1280/2048) + Speed (32)
combined_features = torch.cat([visual_features, speed_features], dim=1)
```

### Key Features
- **Speed normalization**: Input speeds divided by 100 km/h for stability
- **Feature fusion**: Speed embeddings concatenated with visual features
- **Backward compatibility**: Models work with or without speed input

## Training

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Train speed-conditioned model
python train.py --use_speed_input --run_name carla_steering_speed --epochs 60 --batch_size 128

# Train standard model (no speed)
python train.py --run_name carla_steering_standard --epochs 60 --batch_size 128
```

### Parameters
- `--use_speed_input`: Enable speed-conditioned training
- `--run_name`: Model name (suffix `_speed` added automatically for speed models)
- `--epochs`: Training epochs
- `--batch_size`: Batch size
- `--use_all_cameras`: Use center + left/right cameras with offset correction

### Dataset Requirements

The CSV files must contain `speed_kmh` column:
```csv
frame_filename,steering_angle,throttle,brake,speed_kmh,camera_position,frame_number,timestamp
center_0.png,-0.125,0.45,0.0,23.5,center,0,1234567890.123
```

## Training Performance

### Expected Improvements
- **Better generalization** across speed ranges
- **Reduced steering oscillations** at high speeds  
- **More responsive control** at low speeds
- **Improved path following** consistency

### Training Tips
1. **Balanced data**: Ensure diverse speed distributions in training data
2. **Speed range**: Train on speeds from 5-80 km/h for best coverage
3. **Data augmentation**: Horizontal flip correctly adjusts both image and steering
4. **Learning rates**: Use different rates for backbone vs. head (1e-4 vs. 1e-3)

## Inference

### Automatic Model Detection

The inference script automatically detects speed-conditioned models:

```python
# Auto-detects speed models by filename containing "_speed"
python predict_steering_in_carla.py --model_path "carla_steering_best_speed.pt" --max_speed 35
```

### Model Loading Process
1. **Filename check**: Models with `_speed` loaded as speed-conditioned
2. **Architecture match**: Automatically creates correct model architecture  
3. **Fallback handling**: If loading fails, tries standard model
4. **Runtime adaptation**: Uses speed input only if model supports it

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Speed-conditioned model (auto-detected)
python predict_steering_in_carla.py --model_path "checkpoints_weathers/carla_steering_best_speed.pt" --town Town02 --max_speed 35

# Standard model
python predict_steering_in_carla.py --model_path "checkpoints_weathers/carla_steering_best.pt" --town Town02 --max_speed 25
```

## Performance Analysis

### Speed-Specific Metrics

The analysis system tracks speed-dependent performance:

```python
# Speed vs. steering correlation
speed_steering_correlation = analyze_speed_steering_relationship(speeds, steering_angles)

# Performance by speed bins
low_speed_rmse = calculate_rmse(speeds < 15)
high_speed_rmse = calculate_rmse(speeds > 30)
```

### Expected Results

| Speed Range | Standard Model | Speed-Conditioned |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 5-15 km/h   | Good          | Good              |
| 15-30 km/h  | Moderate      | **Improved**      |
| 30+ km/h    | Poor          | **Much Better**   |

## Implementation Benefits

## File Outputs

### Model Files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Size mismatch error**: 
   - Model filename doesn't match architecture
   - Solution: Use correct `_speed` suffix or standard name

2. **Missing speed_kmh column**:
   - Dataset CSV missing speed data
   - Solution: Regenerate dataset with speed logging

3. **Performance degradation**:
   - Insufficient speed range in training data
   - Solution: Collect data across wider speed range

### Debug Mode

```python
# Enable detailed logging
python train.py --use_speed_input --run_name debug_speed --epochs 5 --batch_size 32
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-input models**: Add throttle, brake, gear as additional inputs
2. **Temporal fusion**: Combine speed with previous steering commands  
3. **Adaptive embedding**: Learn speed embedding size during training
4. **Speed prediction**: Predict optimal speed along with steering

## Conclusion

Speed-conditioned training significantly improves autonomous driving performance by teaching the model to adapt its steering strategy based on current velocity. This addresses fundamental limitations of single-input models and provides more robust, real-world applicable steering control.

The implementation is backward-compatible, automatically detected, and requires minimal changes to existing workflows while providing substantial performance improvements, especially at higher speeds.
